# Summary of scripts for figures in model description section

1. *plots\_cxr\_txa\_model.m*:
Generates the following figures of the methods section: FigM2, FigM3, FigM5, FigM6
Analyzes distribution of mono-allelic up-regulation and maximal bi-allelic up-regulation in stochastic simulation (FigM2 and FigM6).
Analyzes the parameter distribution in the sets that can maintain the XaXi state and the sets that can generate mono-allelic Xist up-regulation (FigM3).
Plots the Xist - cXR phase space for different tXa doses (FigM4).
Plots the Xist - cXR phase space for change in p12 and p14 values (FigM5).
