# XCI model
Code used for publication [Mutzel et al, ....](http://...)

## Structure of the root folder
On the first structuring level it is divided into:
- 'data' which contains all experimental measurements and the microscopy images that are included in the figures
- 'scripts' which contains all simulation scripts and all analysis scripts that generate the figures
- 'simulations' which contains all parameter and result files of the simulations
- 'plots' into which all plots generated by the analysis scripts in the folder 'scripts' are saved
On the second structuring level each of these folders contains multiple subfolders divided by the figures of the paper. 
In the 'scripts' folder, each of these subfolders contains a *README.md* file which contains an explanation about the files in the respective folder

## Information on the simulations
- Scripts to generate the parameter sets are written in matlab
- Scripts to analyze the simulations and generate the figures are written in matlab
- ODE model is simulated in matlab
- The stochastic cXR-tXA Gillespie model is written in Julia and was simulated on a computing cluster
- The stochastic Xist/Tsix model is written in matlab and c++. To allow matlab to call the c++ functions a C++ MEX file of each *.cpp* file needs to be constructed with:
```
mex filename.cpp
```
where filename is the name of the source cpp file. The mex files present in the folders have been compiled with MATLAB 2018b and might not run with other MATLAB versions. Compilation requires the Boost C++ libraries.
